QA with Multimodal RAG: Document Retrieval and Vision Language Models

CAS NLP, Module 4 Project, Sandro Wiedmer, Jan'25
   - Domain-/product-specific QA: RAG document retrieval with several manuals of an X-ray generator product family
   - Beside text, information is also included in images and tables
   - Use case: Could be helpful for Technical Customer Support, service personnel, customers (OEMs) and end-users, to quickly find information by asking questions in natural language about product usage, debugging, maintenance etc. which by classical text search does not work to the same degree of satisfaction
